"could say im a chill guy, very good at work but lazy, im a fat###, i love cats (specially milo, the one on my pfp) and i like rpgs and fighting games in general, i like anything that my ears like and im usually very introverted and unsociable, if i like you then im sticking around you as much as i can and i dont really like sports but i enjoy basketball, im a project moon enthusiast and poser (yes im admiting it i dont get whats wrong) and i like photography, thats pretty much it for me, i could add something more but i will run out of space or it will be too empty so im not trying for now (i did it didnt i? doesnt matter, its not like i didnt want to lol)"
